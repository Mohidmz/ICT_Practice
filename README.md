Information and Communication Technology (ICT) means more to me than just using computers or the internet — it represents connection, learning, and innovation. ICT has made the world faster, smarter, and more accessible. For me, it’s a way to communicate, create, and solve problems using technology.

Through ICT, I can explore new ideas, learn from anywhere, and share my thoughts with the world. It helps me stay connected with people, organize my work, and discover opportunities. ICT is not just a subject — it’s a powerful tool that shapes the way we live, study, and think in today’s digital age.

In short, ICT teaches me how to use technology responsibly, think critically, and become part of a world that never stops evolving.
